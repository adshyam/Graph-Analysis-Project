Graph Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze a graph dataset provided in the "person_knows_person.csv" file. The project involves using different 
algorithms to analyze the graph and visualize the results.


Shortest Path
To find the shortest path in the graph, I used Dijkstra and A* algorithms. To avoid working with a large graph, I have  created a smaller file 
and worked on the smaller graph.

MST
To find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and remove other edges, I have used Prim and Kruskal algorithms.

PageRank and HITS
To order the graph nodes based on their importance, I used the PageRank and HITS algorithms. Sine the graph was too large for 
my system, I made a smaller file and used a subgraph.

Visualization
To visualize the results of the PageRank and HITS algorithms, I used a color scheme where higher-ranked nodes had denser 
colors and lower-ranked nodes had lighter colors. The size of the 
node circle was used to visualize the importance of a node in PageRank and HITS.

Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a graph dataset using various algorithms and visualizations.
